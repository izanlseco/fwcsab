## -- INSTRUCTIONS to use the board --

The 'single commas' are just for syntax purposes, DO NOT type them in.

1. Compile the jar file.
2. Type in the command-line: 'java -jar location/of/jarfile.jar'.
3. Then you can type one of the following commands: 'create', 'summary' or 'exit'.
4. If 'create' is typed, just follow the instructions.
5. If 'summary' is typed, you'll get info as in the output example.
6. If 'exit' is typed, the program ends.

## -- Added TESTS --

In order to launch them you have to clone the repo into your IDE (I've used IntelliJ) and just launch the tests. They have some simple logging.
